* This is super level
This is something that will not get incorporated into the actual
TODO element, but it should be conserved if the TODO is changed.


We have two blank lines above this one. And one blank line before
the next TODO item.

** TODO This is TODO 1
DEADLINE: <2017-10-20>

This TODO item has a deadline.
.
That's a line containing a period.
** DONE This is TODO 2
This is the last line.
