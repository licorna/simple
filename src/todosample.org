* This is super level
This is something that will not get incorporated into the actual
TODO element, but it should be conserved if the TODO is changed.


We have two blank lines above this one. And one blank line before
the next TODO item.

** TODO This is TODO 1
DEADLINE: <2017-10-20>

This TODO item has a deadline.
.
That's a line containing a period.
** DONE This is TODO 2
This is the last line.


* This is the Actual TODO section for Simple
** DONE DOING Be able to read full TODO items
This means that not only the title (the thing) with the * on it, but
also the contents, like this text in here. I'm interested in the
following section:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  # this section is actionable, and will get triggered at some point.

  import antigravity
#+END_SRC

** DONE Use the DEADLINE attribute
DEADLINE: <2017-10-10>
The DEADLINE attribute should exist for Simple, so this attribute
needs to be read.

** DOING Nodes should be a tree structure.
Nodes should be a tree structure, they can have tasks as children
(with lesser "levels").

** TODO Items or tasks should have editable content
So this text should appear in the TODO item and should be editable.

** TODO Repetition Feature
Tasks should be repeatable, using org semantics.

** TODO Desktop Notification
I'm not sure about this, but probably I should allow actionable
Desktop Notifications.

** TODO Actionable tasks
By adding #+BEGIN_SRC env #+END_SRC clients should be able to program
using Python (initially) some simple code that gets some data from the
environment, somehow.

*** TODO Actionable tasks the moment the deadline is reached

*** TODO Actionable notification tasks -> send email or something

*** TODO Actionable -> implement helper API (to send emails or SMS)
